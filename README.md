## Motivation
Traditional policy development has always been a linear
process and is tackled by a limited group of experts at a
certain entity. Today citizens are the main stakeholders
and they can find appropriate solutions to problems
through their experiences and expectation.
## What is ideate?
#### Platform for innovative solutions on government challenges
Sometimes itâ€™s not the government that is not willing to
innovate, rather limited access to innovative ideas. We
try to solve that by allowing the government to create a
platform where it can crowdsource innovation from the
citizens themselves, in exchange of incentives to the
best deserving users.

#### Innovative solutions other than challenges
How many times have you thought of a problem at a
government office that can be solved in an efficient
way? Often, right. And a few government departments
also encourage these inputs but currently through
emails. We provide a one stop solution for all
departments to maintain their innovative ideas easily.

#### Powered by AI
* **Content similarity**   
 Whenever a citizen tries to upload an innovative
solution to a challenge, we provide with a similarity
metric to the citizen, Which helps them gives the most
innovative solutions. And also on the governments end,
we give them the answers sorted according to
uniqueness , which keeps it easier for the government to
find the best answers easily.This is done using an LSTM sequence to sequence model, word embeddings are calculated using GLOVE.
* **Plagiarism and relevancy check**   
This feature is for the government departments end.
This helps in removing the directly copy and pasted
answers. And also the administrator can choose to sort
according to the relevancy of the solution to the questions
